Things to add:

-Loading progress
-Pagination/Infinite scroll
-Change colour scheme for more accessibility (more contrast) 
-Testing
-Better mobile responsive (so don't need to refresh page)  
-Lazy loading (if lots of components)
-Image preprocessor? - reduce image size if not done at backend 
 
To fix:

-Errors due to packages used 
-NPM security errors 
 
Decide on better approach:

-Used two methods for layout- grid and flexbox
